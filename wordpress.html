<p>Surprisingly, this was the most difficult assignment for me.
    I'm not sure what it was, but I had a very hard time figuring out how to use the interface.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I had such a hard time using wordpress, I never finished the assignment.
    I struggled to create and link different pages, I couldn't get the template to look right, and I felt like the whole 
    think was very buggy overall.
</p>
<p>I'm sure it was just user error on my part, but it's surprising I had an easier time with coding than on a website builder!</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the home page I started, but I could never get it to look any better than this.</p>
