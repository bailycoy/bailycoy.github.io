<p>HTML coding was our very first 2 assignments of the semester.</p>
<p>I had never tried coding before, but it was always something I was interested in learning.</p>

<br>

<p>A few examples of what we leared to do:</p>
    <p>Make lists</p>
    <p>Add links</p>
    <p>Add photos and videos</p>
    <p>leave comments within the code</p>

<br>
<br>

    <p>This is an example of a video we learned to add!</p>
    <video width="403" height="302" controls>
        <source src="corkscrew.mp4" alt="Corkscrew Video">
    </video>
<br>

<br>

<p>The coolest part of coding a website is being able to look at it when it is finished and 
    know that you created all of it!</p>

<br>

<P>My first website had a total of three pages that were all linked together by a navigation bar, just like this one.</P>
<p>These are the pictures of my website's code once it was finished!</p>
