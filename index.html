<div><p>Welcome to my website!</p></div>
<br>

<p>This page is dedicated to sharing the trips I was lucky enough to take this summer.</p>
<p>I took two trips back to back at the end of July 2021.</p>
<br>

<p>The first place I went was to Lake Tahoe, CA with my family.</p>

<p>We stayed at a family friend's cabin and did tons of fun stuff while we were there.</p>

<p>After spending the week with my family, I flew back home to Boise and spend two days at home before taking off for 
    trip number two!</p>
<br>

<p>My second vacation was a belated birthday trip to Silverwood Theme Park in Athol, ID.</p>

<p>I love rollercoasters and I convinced my boyfriend to drive to Northern Idaho just so we could ride Silverwood's 
    brand new coaster called Stunt Pilot.</p>
