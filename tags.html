<p><b>My name is Baily Coy</b></p>

<p>I have only the smallest experience coding, but I am <i>very</i> excited to show off my new and improved skills!</p>
<p>While this is just a basic HTML website, this is a showcase of everything we have learned in class so far.</p>

<p>These are some of the <b>new</b> things I have learned how to do:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create and link to other pages</li>
    <li>Create spaces for forms to be submitted</li>
    <li>The basics of CSS</li>
</ol>

<p>These are some fun facts about me:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I am a senior at Boise State University</li>
    <li>I used to work at Disneyland</li>
    <li>I have the world's cutest dog</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh! You want to see a picture of my dog? Don't worry I have plenty!</p>
<p>But all of those pictures and videos are on the Media page above!</p>

<p>Check out the links at the top to see the pictures I mentioned and even more!</p>
